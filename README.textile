h1. sbteclipse

This project is a plugin for "sbt 0.11.x":http://github.com/harrah/xsbt/ providing a command to create "Eclipse":http://www.eclipse.org/ project files from a sbt project (possibly containing subprojects).

h2. Latest changes

* #27: Add info message "This might take some time ..." when command starts
* #24: Switch to sbt 0.11

h2. Installing sbteclipse as a sbt plugin

* To "install" the plugin, either use a local or the globel plugin definition (for details about sbt plugins please see the "sbt documentation":https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/Plugins):
** The local plugin is just a _build.sbt_ file in the _project/plugins_ folder of your project
** The global plugin is defined via a _build.sbt_ file in the directory _~/.sbt/plugins_.
* Just add the below lines to your _build.sbt_ file, paying attention to the blank lines:

<pre><code>
resolvers += Classpaths.typesafeResolver

addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbteclipse" % "sbteclipse" % "1.4-RC1")
</code></pre>

h2. Using sbteclipse to create Eclipse project files

* As soon as sbteclipse is properly set up as a plugin, you can use the command _eclipse_ in an sbt session to create Eclipse project files
* There is autocompletion available, just use the tab key
* After having created the Eclipse project files you can import the project in Eclipse using the "Import Wizard" to import "Existing Projects into Workspace"

h2. Options

* _create-src_ to create the common source directories, e.g. _src/main/scala_, _src/main/test_, etc.
* _same-targets_ to make sbt and Eclipse compile into the same target directories; by default the Eclipse directories will be different, e.g. _.target_
* _skip-root_ to skip project creation for the root project
* _with-sources_ to create source attachments for the library dependencies

h2. Example

<pre><code>tmp$ mkdir test
tmp$ cd test
test$ sbt
> eclipse create-src
[info] Successfully created Eclipse project files. Please select the appropriate Eclipse plugin for Scala 2.9.1!
</code></pre>
